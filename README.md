# DeepTrans

An experimental neural code translator developed by SKLP, ICT, CAS

## What's about

a neural code translator supporting various remote LLMs, local LLMs and finetuned LLMs, with careful task decompositions to support real-world repository-level code translation between multiple programming languages.

## Key Features

- Repository-level auto decomposition
- Control-block-level auto function decomposition and translation
- Control-block-level auto unittest generation

## Roadmap

TBD
